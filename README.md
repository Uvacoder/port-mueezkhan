# learn.mueezkhan.com

This is the code repository for [https://learn.mueezkhan.com](https://learn.mueezkhan.com).

Built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site) and TailwindCSS.

## Tips

Note that it's not easy using TailwindCSS styles in .mdx files, so I suggest making React components for them.

## Contributing

The repository follows [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) commit conventions.

To run the [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli#readme) for ease of use using npm:

### Install gitmoji-cli

```bash
npm i -g gitmoji-cli
```

### Run gitmoji-cli after `git add`

```bash
gitmoji -c
```

For more help [read the `gitmoji-cli` README.md](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli#readme).

### When merging PRs

When merging a PR, make sure to include gitmoji's convention of using `:twisted_rightwards_arrows:` :twisted_rightwards_arrows: as its intention.
