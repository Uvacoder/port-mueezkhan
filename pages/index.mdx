# Welcome!

This site is a place where I create and collect learning resources that I, and possibly you, may find useful.

## Is this site complete?

This site is a **work in progress** as of right now. I plan to work on:

- A [resources page](/resources/introduction) with various sections to choose from
- A **notes page** with various notes from online courses, videos, etc.
- A **courses page** where I teach various topics I'm interested in
- An [about page](/about) that goes more into the details of this website and me

Feel free to take a look around and see if you find anything interesting!
